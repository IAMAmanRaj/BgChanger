# Background Changer App

A simple web application that utilizes the PhotoRoom API to change the background of images. Customize the prompt and negative prompt for accurate background removal.

## Prerequisites

Before using the app, you need to obtain an API key from PhotoRoom. Follow these steps:

1. Visit [PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. Navigate to your account settings or API section to generate an API key.
3. Copy the generated API key for use in the app.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and move to the app directory.
2. npm run dev will have the program up and running.
3. Fill in the following information:

   - **Prompt:** Enter a descriptive prompt to guide the background change process.
   - **Negative Prompt:** Provide a prompt that clarifies what should not be included in the image.
   - **Image Upload:** Select an image file from your device that you want to process.

4. Click the "Change Background" button to initiate the process.
5. The app will communicate with the PhotoRoom API using your API key to perform the background change.
6. Once the process is complete, you'll see the modified image with the new background under the Response Image section.

## Important Note

- Ensure that you have an active internet connection while using this app, as it relies on the PhotoRoom API to process images.
- The API key you obtained is sensitive information. Keep it secure and do not share it with others.
- Remember that the quality of the output image depends on the clarity of your prompt and negative prompt.
